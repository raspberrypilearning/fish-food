Once the training has finished, you can test how well your model recognises your voice commands.  

--- task ---

Click the **Start listening** button, then say "left". 
--- /task ---

If your machine learning model recognises it, it will display what it predicts you said.

--- task ---
Test whether the model recognises "up", "down", and "right" as well.
--- /task ---

If you are not happy with how the model works, go back to the **Train** page and add more examples, then train your model again.
