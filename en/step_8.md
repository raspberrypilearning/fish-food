## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Machine Learning with Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-machine-learning) pathway, you can move on to the [Smart Assistant](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/smart-assistant) project. In this project, you will train a smart assistant to be able to control a light and a fan by typing commands.
